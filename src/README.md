## Abstract

Unlocking deep, interpretable biological reasoning from complex genomic data is a major AI challenge hindering scientific discovery. Current DNA foundation models, despite strong sequence representation, struggle with multi-step reasoning and lack inherent transparent, biologically intuitive explanations. We introduce BIOREASON, a pioneering architecture that, for the first time, deeply integrates a DNA foundation model with a large language model (LLM). This novel connection enables the LLM to directly process and reason with genomic information as a fundamental input, fostering a new form of multimodal biological understanding. BIOREASON's sophisticated multi-step reasoning is developed through supervised fine-tuning and targeted reinforcement learning, guiding the system to generate logical, biologically coherent deductions. Across biological reasoning benchmarks, BIOREASON significantly improves performance, raising accuracy on KEGG-based disease pathway prediction from 86% to 98% and delivering an average 15% gain over strong single-modality baselines in variant effect prediction tasks. BIOREASON reasons over unseen biological entities and articulates decision-making through interpretable, step-by-step biological traces, offering a transformative approach for AI in biology that enables deeper mechanistic insights and accelerates testable hypothesis generation from genomic data. Data, code, and checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/bowang-lab/BioReason

## Key Contributions

• **Novel multimodal architecture**: The first successful integration of a DNA foundation model with an LLM, establishing a new methodology for AI-driven biological studies.

• **Advanced reasoning methodology**: A systematic training approach combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning that incentivizes multi-step biological reasoning.

• **New biological reasoning benchmarks**: Development and curation of novel benchmarks for evaluating biological reasoning capabilities, including an annotated reasoning dataset for gene pathway and disease prediction from KEGG.

• **Empirical performance improvements**: Demonstration that BioReason outperforms both DNA foundation models and LLMs used independently or in simple combination, with average performance gains of 15%+ over baseline.

• **Interpretable reasoning traces**: A mechanism for generating step-by-step biological reasoning traces that provide interpretable predictions, enhancing scientific insight and hypothesis generation.
